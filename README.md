## Objectives
According to a survey report people spend an average of 5.4 hours a day on their phone, of which the adolescents spend a slightly higher smartphone screen time of 5.7 hours. Furthermore, recent World Health Organization (WHO-2016) study estimates 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and above are overweight; Of these, over 650 million adults were obese.The study also indicates increase in the obese population with each year passing by. This trend of increasing obesity epidemic is linked with the excessive use of smart phones (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts,2010). Considering people spend a substantial amount of time using technology, innovative apps can be used to motivate regular fitness activities (Cummiskey, 2011). On the other hand, a survey conducted by our team suggests that fitness enthusiasts have a difficult time finding healthy options. Moreover, some people struggle to stay motivated for a longer amount of time and tend to deviate themselves from a healthy lifestyle after a while. 

## Solution
Worthy Walk is a smart phone application that provides its users a platform to achieve fitness goals by walking, running or cycling. In reward, Worthy Walk provides them Knubs (currency discussed later in the document) to be redeemed as discounts in our store for motivation. It also provides fitness enthusiasts to look for healthy eating, clothing, and other options all in one place.
